# 🎉 Welcome to the JCL Simulation Framework!

## 🚀 Quick Start

1. **Run the demo to see everything in action:**
   ```bash
   ./demo.sh
   ```

2. **Try your first exercise:**
   ```bash
   # Read the exercise instructions
   cat STUDENT_EXERCISE_1.md
   
   # Test your setup
   ./test_student_exercise.sh
   ```

3. **Learn the concepts:**
   ```bash
   # Read the comprehensive guide
   cat BASH_VS_JCL_GUIDE.md
   ```

## 📚 Learning Path

1. **Start Here:** `GETTING_STARTED.md`
2. **Main Guide:** `BASH_VS_JCL_GUIDE.md`
